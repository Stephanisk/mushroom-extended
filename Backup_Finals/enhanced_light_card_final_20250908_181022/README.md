## Technical Notes

### Background Image Opacity Implementation
The latest version implements background image opacity using a sophisticated approach:

- **Full Opacity (1.0):** Uses direct `background-image` CSS property for optimal performance
- **Custom Opacity (<1.0):** Uses `linear-gradient` overlay technique to achieve transparency without affecting card content
- **No Stacking Context Issues:** Unlike previous opacity implementations, this approach doesn't interfere with popup z-index

### Styling Architecture
The card uses a dynamic styling system that builds CSS properties based on configuration options. This allows for extensive customization while maintaining performance and avoiding CSS conflicts.

### Inheritance Structure
